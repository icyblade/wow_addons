-- Big Wigs Release Procedure
--[[

Here's just a list of things the release manager needs to do before
pushing a new release to wowace/curse and wowinterface.

1. Check that there are no open tickets on wowace that would affect a
   release.

2. Check that BigWigs.toc in the root folder has the correct Version.
   And, if not, update it and commit.

3. Run the lua script under Options/scripts to update the credits.
   And don't forget to commit it!

4. Scan the code for any Lua comments starting with XXX and verify that
   these do not hinder the next release.
   (find . -name "*.lua" | xargs grep 'XXX' -n)

5. Download the latest alpha zip (with libs) and install that in a clean
   Interface\AddOns folder without other addons.

6. Start up WoW and navigate through ALL the options to verify that
   nothing breaks instantly.

7. Run the ingame Test, just spam click the button at least 20 times
   on a character of level 40 or higher.

8. Get a "go" from either Ammo or Rabbit on irc.freenode.net/#wowace.

 -> Release!
