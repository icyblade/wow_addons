    How to set up Big Wigs for boss announcements

The most important plugins for a raid warner (you) are the RaidWarn and
BossBlock plugins.

Navigate to the RaidWarner plugin in the menu and make
sure you have the "Broadcast" and "Whisper" options checked.

Next, go to the BossBlock plugin and uncheck "Suppress RaidWarn Chat". This
makes sure you can see what boss announcements you are sending to the raid
warning channel for people who do not run Big Wigs. People running Big Wigs will
automatically block any bossmod messages sent to this channel since they will
get the same messages colorcoded in their in-game UI/HUD anyway.

In some fights, Big Wigs sends whispers (tells) to your raid members when they
are affected by some things like "bombs". If you do not want to see these
whispers as you send them, you can turn off "Show whispers" in the RaidWarn
menu.

    How to trigger custom bars for your raid

Big Wigs comes prepacked with a means of starting your own custom bars in the
CustomBar extra plugin. You can access it with /bwcb or through the Extras menu.
Lets say you want to start a timer for a small break of 10 minutes, all you do
is /bwcb 600 Break! and it will start a 10 minute timer for everyone with Big
Wigs in your raid, and will give a message/raidwarn notification when the timer
has expired.


    How to check what version other people have

Using /bwv, you can query the raid for what version of BigWigs your members have.

Remember that people do not always have to have the latest revision for things
to work, please do not abuse the version query as most people do not enjoy
upgrading things every day.
