This document is intended for raid participants.

    When the fight begings

Big Wigs automatically senses the nearby presence of a boss and enables the
appropriate bossmod without delay. Normally, you're not required to do anything.


    BossBlock

The BossBlock plugin is the main thing keeping your sanity during boss
encounters. It blocks any raid warning text that is determined to be boss
announcement chatter.

Most people will want to have all the BossBlock options checked, they will only
block what you will be notified for in the BigWigs message frame anyway.


    If you get hungry during the raid

Big Wigs comes prepacked with a module for starting custom bars, which is
excellent for when your pizza is in the oven. Just throw that baby in there, run
back to your computer, and execute /bwlcb 720 Pizza!. 720 seconds is 12 minutes,
which you'll obviously want to configure to your liking :)

This bar is local to your client, and others won't be able to see it.


    Moving the bars and messages

The bars and messages plugins for Big Wigs can be moved with an anchor that can
be toggled on from the plugins submenus Bars and Messages. After moving them,
the test plugin can give you a couple of bars and messages to test your position
and if you're fine with it.

Remember that there are several bar textures available, as well as several
output locations for the messages; for example SCT or MSBT.
