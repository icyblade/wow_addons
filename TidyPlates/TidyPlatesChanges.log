Tidy Plates 6.6...
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Highlights

Headline Mode
Instead of displaying a graphical health-bar, we can display critical information using just text, reducing the surface area of the nameplate and revealing more of the game world.  The Headline style can be mixed with traditional Health Bar nameplates to improve your awareness and reduce visual clutter.

Compact Debuff Widget
In addition to numerous performance improvements, the current version of the Debuff widget now includes the option to use Square icons!
	
Detachable Hub Panel
Click the minimize button to unsnap the Hub panel into it's own smaller, draggable configuration window.

Speedy Configuration
Use '/hub' to quickly enter the active Hub Panel. 

Bookmarks
In the Hub, use the 'Bookmarks' button to jump to a category.

Improved Copy & Paste
This is a simple method of transferring profiles between characters.  Clicking the Hub's 'Copy' button will save your settings to a global database.  The data persists even if your computer is turned-Off.  Clicking the 'Paste' button will replace your current settings with the Copied settings.  You can paste between characters on different servers.  

Using the 'Shift' key while clicking will use a different clipboard, isolated to the Hub's Role Type, but still acessible between characters.  In other words, you've got three slots (Universal, Tank, and Damage) to copy your settings.

Performance Improvements
Refinement of the caching systems has reduced Memory and CPU usage.  Some folks have seen dramatic FPS drops.  This update should fix that stuff!

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cumulative Changes Since 6.5:

	- Under the "Style" category, all references to "Text-Only Plates" or "TextPlates" have been changed to "Headline Mode".  This change is intended to distinguish the style modifier from other references to "Text".  I'm sure some of you will hate this (can you come up with something better?), but I'm hoping that less cranky folks find the new grammar to be more intuitive.
	- To support the "Headline Mode" name change, I've added a new category.  Can you guess?  It's, "Headline".  
	- I've grouped the "Color" and "Text" categories into "Color & Text", and moved them to the second-category position.  Why??  1: "Color & Text" controls the appearance of the default 'Health Bar' style.  2: Underneath, "Headline" controls the appearance of the 'No Bar' style.  Thus: This arrangement puts these options close to where the user selects the modes, in the "Style" category.
	- Square Debuff Icon Option: Added a new Debuff Widget option, "Debuff Style", which allows the user to select between the traditional "Wide" debuff format, or a more squareish "Compact" style.  The column count is increased to 5 for the "Compact" style.
	- Bookmark System: Added a "Bookmark" system to the Hub panels, which allows a user to jump directly to any of the categories
	- On certain themes, the position of your debuffs will be adjusted to allow the combo point widget to comfortably fit (on Rogues and Druids, only).  When the combo widget is disabled, the icons will "snug" themselves closer to the plate. 
	- Using the '/hub' command will bring you to the Hub Configuration panel for your current theme
	- Added click sounds to the 'Copy' and 'Paste' buttons
	- Bug fixes and Memory optimization
	- Added a Prefilter option for the debuff widget cache
		* The hub enables the prefilter, when you're using the 'By Prefix" mode
		* Debuffs NOT on your list are not cached
		* This should save a ton of memory if you're using 'By Prefix'
	- Made some changes to the Unit Data Cache system to reduce memory use, and avoid certain 'lag' events...
		* Pet/Companion NPC titles are no longer cached
		* Cached unit guild and npc titles are now stored within the TidyPlatesWidgetData variable, keeping this data out of the base TidyPlates saved variables
		* Hub/Reset button will now clear the cached unit descriptions/titles and guilds
		* Unit descriptions (player guild name, or NPC role/title) will not be displayed while in an instance.  This is to avoid the CPU overhead that occurs when searching the database, which could be THOUSANDS of entries.  This is a direct cause for massive FPS drop, in some cases.
		* A side-effect of these changes is the clearing of user's stored guild names and NPC titles.  This is required to get the desired performance benefits.
	- Matched widget duration timer to default blizz interface standard (using 'floor' rather than 'ceil') 
	- Fixed SpellId variable name in widgets\tank.lua
	- Spell Cast Monitor: If cast time is not greater than 0, make it a minimum of 1.5s
	- Added NameColorByEnemyClass
	- Minimize Hub now scale to 85%
	- Rearranged Name Color: By Friendly/Enemy class
	- Improved HealerTrack.lua, with help from Curseforge user, dakunesu.  Improves detection of healers in battlegrounds! Rockin!
	- Added a "Minimize" button to the /hub UI panel.  Clicking this will detach the Hub panel from the Interface Options window, and make it smaller.  Good for configuring stuff while playing.
	- The Copy & Paste buttons for the Hub panels now work with a unified Clipboard, so you can Copy & Paste between Tank and DPS panels.  Holding down "Shift" while clicking Copy or Paste will use the original Tank/DPS-specific caches.
	- New Hub Option: "Bring Casting Units to Spotlight Scale"
	- Unit Cache should filter out reputation names.  This fixes an issue occuring when "Colorblind" mode is active, causing Reputation to be displayed instead of an NPC's Title.
	- "Filter > Filter Inactive": When a unit is marked with a target/raid-icon, it's now assumed to be Active.
	- And more (ie. stuff I've forgotten about)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	- More memory tricks/optimization for Mr. Debuff Widget.
	- Added a few more Headline Modes

(r452 Beta5)
	- Fixed nil table index in HealerTrack.lua
	- Added a Prefilter option for the debuff widget cache
		* The hub enables the prefilter, when you're using the 'By Prefix" mode
		* Debuffs NOT on your list are not cached
		* This should save a ton of memory, if you're using 'By Prefix'

(r451 Beta4)
	- Made some changes to reduce memory use, and avoid certain 'lag' events...
		* Pet/Companion NPC titles are no longer cached
		* Cached unit guild and npc titles are now stored within the TidyPlatesWidgetData variable, keeping this data out of the base TidyPlates saved variables
		* Hub/Reset button will now clear the cached unit descriptions/titles and guilds
		* Unit descriptions (player guild name, or NPC role/title) will not be displayed while in an instance.  This is to avoid the CPU overhead that occurs when searching the database.
		* A side-effect of these changes is the clearing of user's stored guild names and NPC titles.  This is required to get the desired performance benefits.

	* Changed 'Frame' category to 'Advanced'
	* Added an option under 'Advanced'; "Enable Unit-Data Caching".  (Disabling this will stop non-party/pvp class-coloring)
	* Added a filter to the Unit-Data cache, to skip characters from other other realms
	* Unit-Data caching is bypassed while in an instance (Both PvP and PvE)
	* The caching system will peek at /who requests, and store the info on the Unit-Data table (Unless it's disabled)

-----------------
6.4...
		
(r363)

(r358)
- Added: Tip text next to Hub Debuff widget config
- Fixed: Friendly Group unit class coloring
- Re-removed: Minimap button.  The code is still there, but hidden.  If you liked the button, use this command:   /run TidyPlatesOptions._EnableMiniButton = true; ReloadUI()

(r355)
- Fixed: List-to-lookup table conversion for Unit Filter, By Name
- Fixed: Hub/Tank slider ranges (They were not actually broken, just different from the Damage Hub)

(r350)
- Fixed: Incorrect Paths in TidyPlatesWidgets (causing several widgets to not work)
- Fixed: Hub Tank Panel, SplitToTable error

(r348)

(r338)
- Debuff Priority works for "Show Specific" and "Show My Specific" modes, in addition to "By Prefix"
- Class Icon Widget: Returned to using internal artwork
- All textures are now Non-blocking (the game won't wait for textures to load into memory before it draws the scene), preventing texture changes from affecting frame rate
- The debuff widget (should now be called Aura Widget) will track buffs for friendly players

(r308)
- Debuff widget now uses single dimension tables to store cached data, to improve memory management
- Moved Widgets to their own addon/folder (For memory usage tracking)
- Statusbar gradients are now supported via additional return values in theme.SetHealthbarColor()... 
	* return r1, g1, b1, [r2, g2, b2]
- The Debuff widget now supports 'priority' through the existing .filter function... example:
	* return showThisAura, auraPriority 
- The Hub Panels will check the order of the debuffs in its list to determine priority.
- Class Widget no longer uses internal class artwork; Instead, the class icon is pulled from the Blizz UI library.
- If theme.SetCastbarColor returns nil, the cast animation will be skipped
	* This can be used to filter spell casting data

6.3
-----------------

6.3.8 (r307)

6.3.5 (r295)
- Self-Test for DebuffWidget.lua added, in order to inform users of possible issues.  (I hope to address auto-updater bug)
- Cleaned up some code to reduce "double calls" to delegate and update functions 

6.3.4 (r293)
- More Debuff Widget fixes
- Improved Debuff Widget memory usage

6.3.1 (r289) 
- Fixed debuff update stalling
- Added nil value error protection to debuff prefix sorter

6.3.0 (r284) 55,754
	* Updated functions for 4.2
	* Increased width of sliders in Hub
	* Opacity functions now use a transfer function to correct the opacity (currently, .5 does not translate to 50% opaque; it's more like 65%)
	* Channeled spells now move the cast bar in reverse.
	* Friendly/Enemy "V-key" Automation; In Combat, Out of Combat, Always
	* Debuff widget now Caches texture of debuffs (to fix sunfire phenomenon, and similar)

6.2 (r269) 
-----------------
* The Hub gets a new category: Style
	- This new category has two menus for Friendly and Enemy nameplates
	- Users can select between two styles (Health Bars vs Text Only), and several different visibility conditions.
	- If you use the Text Only bars, you might want to check out the Name Text Color options, to spice up that text!
* Spell Cast Monitor name search will now strip the "-" from the combat log name, which should fix PvP cast association issues.
* Debuff Widget will now strip the "-" from combat log events, which should fix pvp association issues
* fixed a 'nil' error during pet/tank association
* "Avoid Overlap" has been updated for the new CVar types

6.1
-------------

6.1.13
	- tweaked name color function

6.1.12
	- Fixed Hub/Tank NameTextColor errors
	- Updated description of "Vertical Position of Frame" to "Vertical Position of Artwork"

	NEW! Keyword filtering for the Debuff Widget
	- See Demo on Youtube: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KjGFd0TgvM
	- By Prefix.. Mode for Debuff Widget
		- ALL, MY, NO, OTHER, CC
		- Using CC will eventually highlight the debuff on the widget, but for now it just acts as "ALL"
		
	- Fixed UnitChannelInfo interruptable spell argument bug
	- Found a bug; The Editboxes contained in my ScrollFrames seem to invisibly extend past the bottom of the scrollframe, which can block underlying UI controls.  I've dropped the editboxes to a lower frame level, which is a hack method of preventing problems with it interferring with controls anchored to the bottom of the scrollframe.  Will attempt to figure out a better solution.
	- Name text coloring modes
	- By Raid Icon modes for Opacity and Scale
	
6.1.8 (r227)
	- PTR bug fixes (Neon Threat Glow was turning green)
	- Debuff widget will clear aurainstance tables when combat ends (regen returns)
	- Added Health Text option: Approximate Health (will show 2 decimal places for thousands (k) and millions (M), with suffix)
	- Added Text option, "Use Default Blizzard Font"; This will use the font defined by the global variable, 'NAMEPLATE_FONT'.  This should improve the situation for non-latin charcter sets (this is for you, Chinese, Russians, Taiwanese, and Koreans.. xoxo)	

6.1.7
	- Changed from thousand/million suffix for health text to using a thousands seperator
	- Restored PTR support (last time I checked)
	- Moved Quatre Raid Icon to similar position as Neon (to left side of health bar)

6.1.6
	- Added Events for UNIT_SPELLCAST_NOT_INTERRUPTIBLE, UNIT_SPELLCAST_INTERRUPTIBLE, (This hopefully improves the situation for spells that are uninterruptible being misrepresented)
	- Added Threat Wheel to Hub
	- Reverted to original health % mode (does not show % when full health)
	- WoW 4.1 Compatibility (works on 4.0.x and 4.1)

	- The update function for debuff icons are now exposed via, widget.Poll 
	- Added Events for UNIT_SPELLCAST_NOT_INTERRUPTIBLE, UNIT_SPELLCAST_INTERRUPTIBLE
	- Added Threat Wheel to Hub/function set
	- Reverted to original health % mode; ie. does not show % when full health.  if you like it the other way, edit TidyPlatesHub\functions.lua.  I like it this way, and dammit, it's my software ;-)
	- WoW 4.1 Compatibility (should work on 4.0.x and 4.1, concurrently.  I have not tested on the PTR, though)
	


r199	- Raid Tank Coloring in Tank mode.  Automatically used when in "By Threat" Modes.  
		- Theme list is now Alphabetized 
		- Better handling when previous theme selection does not exist
		- Debuffs of the same spell-id are now handled more securely
		- Reset button in main panel will now reset variables on 'click', turn enemy plates ON and friendlies, OFF
			- 'shift-clicking' will clear and restore the variables, and reload the ui
		- Reset buttons in hub panels also now have a 'click' behavior to reset the variables without reloading the UI
			- 'shift-clicking' will still clear the tables and reload the ui
		- First-run config, turns off friendly nameplates by default
		- Added a link to the Blizzard "Names" panel via the Tidy Plates theme chooser panel
		
r186	- Default Hub Values changed to more closely resemble 6.0.8 defaults  (Blue, Orange Scheme, Threat Warning Glow/Triangles turned On)  
			- A variable reset may be required to revert to the defaults
		- First-run config, "friendly unit bug" fix

6.0	
-------------	
r104-108
TidyPlatesWidgets:GetThreatCondition now sources its group data from the group info table

TidyPlatesWidgets:EnableAggroWatch()
TidyPlatesWidgetsisableAggroWatch()
TidyPlatesWidgets:GetThreatCondition(name)
- Removed the troubleshooting panel.
- Changed "Notes" in TOC
- Spell cast watcher now watches the combat log for casting associated with marked units (raid icons), and will display the cast warning on those units in lieu of a GUID or name.
- Spell Cast events now trigger the SetAlpha functions (in addition to the scale and text functions)
- Spell Cast events send this data to the delegate functions, in addition to normal unit information:
unit.isCasting = true

- Click on theme name in theme chooser window to bring up linked panel (supplied to, theme.InterfacePanel = panelframe)

r72-76: (38,606)
- Anchoring and event handling fixes
- The theme loader will now call 'theme.OnActivateTheme' (a theme function) when the active theme is changed.  it passes two value to the function: the active theme table, and the active theme name.
- The theme loader will call the theme.OnActivateTheme with nil values for ALL themes when a theme is changed.  See the Neon/Tank functions.lua for how and why it's supposed to be used.
- Numerous bug fixes
- The new casting system has been finished.  Neon/Tank will activate it automatically, but you can use '/run TidyPlates:StartSpellCastWatcher()' to enable it for any theme.


r70: 
- Massive changes.  Your themes may not work...
- Removed Cvar for Bloattest
- Added external access for plates tables
- Changed MANY names for things.  See the TidyPlatesDefaults.lua file for the new format names.  To enable an element, use the .show tag under each element.  (No more options.showName = true, etc)
- Added "spelltext" which replaces one of the special text fields.
- removed specialtext fields.  replaced with "spelltext" and "customtext"
- Returned to Virtual Parenting (Tidy Plates Frames are NOT children of the base nameplate.  They are just anchored)
- Elite segments have been removed from the healthborder and threatborder.  Use multi-style if you want different textures
- Elite icon has been added to replace elite segments
- Skull icon texture can now be changed
- Cast bar will continue to display on previous target when you change targets (guesstimated)
- Cast bar will start on a target if you change TO that target, and they are casting a spell (guesstimated)
	- The cast bar may not register interupts fully.  But, it will let you know that the unit is casting.  Quit whining, you babies.
- Preliminary Spell Cast Monitor, in place.  Not yet activated.  You can find this code under the widget folder, in SpellCastMonitor.lua, if you want to enable/play with it.  
	- At this stage of development, If you can't figure out how to enable it on your own, YOU SHOULDN'T.
- Changed the update functions a wee bit to try and reduce CPU load.  Some plates may not be updating correctly.  Complain wisely (ie. with specifics) and it shall be fixed.
- Added a selection box item to the visual elements.  find it under, theme.target


5.15
-------------


r67-68:

- Messed about with Neon/Tank, and added some new code to test, regarding aggro and friendly unit debuffs.

r66:
- lil' Core changes

r59-r65:
- Numerous bug fixes (some of them pretty big)
- "Culling of Old Widget Code"
- Various optimizations
- Reordering of updates (Delegate functions will get updated on TidyPlates:Update() calls, regardless of the 'unit' table having changed)

The R65 release contains the test version of Graphite.

r58: 
- Lil' bug fixes

r54-57:
- Neon now keeps a "Known targetOf list" table, which delegate functions access to highlight non-tanked targets
- Added a simple Combat Log Analyzer to Debuff Widget (To report debuff cancelation back to ID'd units)
- Tank role recognition in Threat Line Widget

5.14
-------------
r50-53:
- fixed nil values during set scale 
- adjusted neon font to 'Qlassik', size, and position for better clarity
- added some comments to the default theme file
- threat line widget will not update on a unit until there is a threat table; meaning, if you're solo, you won't see anything.

r47-49:
- Commented-out improved cast bar code; Saved for another cycle
- removed unit.targetOf determination; too much cpu utilization
- some optimization of the OnUpdate function to improve fading performance 
- Fixed color picker widget being placed under the interface options window
- theme.SetAlpha functions should just return a single value, for absolute alpha (0.0-1.0).  additional returns are ignored
- The theme template table (the one with all the default values) has been changed to no longer look like the Grey theme.  The Grey theme's media is now stored in its own folder.  Choosing "None" as a theme option will show name-text, only.
- TP previously tried to associate arena, party, raid member guids to a nameplate (by name).  This has been removed due to cpu considerations
- Changelog has been updated ;-)
	

r46:
- Still cranky
- fixed the Avoid overlap thingy
- added some update throttling for threat line widget
- commented out some friendly unit guid identification code

r44:
- I'm exhausted and sick and I don't want to even think about this stupid changelog thing and it's a miracle that I'm actually uploading this and I'm going to go to my freaking bed so I can be less cranky in the morning. I'm also hungry, dammit.

r43:
- Improved Fade
- Added a unit.targetOf variable, which the core will attempt to fill, depending on if there is a path to that unit (target, mousover, raid1target, party2target, etc.. doesn't fill from arena, yet)
- Added a .backdrop tag to the statusbars in the style table for themes; The image will appear behind the statusbar.

r40:

* Improved Tug-o'-Threat Widget
- Widget will try to acquire threat data from raid members

* Nameplates will now fade in when they appear

* Improved Cast Bar
- Will now try to estimate the cast of a 
unit, without being targeted.

r28: 
- Added SetCastbarColor function

r26:
- Added SetThreatColor function

- Modified the core to reduce the workload on data updates.
More specifically, I've made new paths for update requests
which avoid updating every single piece of data when only
a single value has changed. 
- Cleaned up some code, and added some new comments

5.12.2
-------------
+ Bugs!


5.12.1 
-------------
+ Better Nesting for Neon and Grey
+ Fix for no-show nameplates



-------------
Beta 1&2
	Beta 1 will launch without Grey.  This is so I can keep focused on features, and then work toward
	the interface panels.  I use Neon, so that's what I'll be testing with.
	+ Notes Widget
		+ Currently only editable via LUA.  Add notes in the widgets\NotesWidget.lua file.
	+ Unit Raid Icon Info
		* STAR, MOON, CIRCLE, SQUARE, DIAMOND, CROSS, TRIANGLE, SKULL
	+ Range-Check Widget (for group members)
		+ Interface (Drop down menu for range)
	+ Packaged Neon with the Main Release
	+ Make Selection Box and Threat Line defaults for Tidy Plates: Neon
	+ Add Level Display Option to Grey
	+ Neon: Make the Enemy Player color pass through (PVP)
	+ Updated Combo Points
	+ Neon: Added health text
	
	
Beta 2B
	
	+ Neon now can show the unit level in its health text field
	+ Added events for PLAYER_CONTROL_LOST, PLAYER_CONTROL_GAINED, UNIT_FACTION
	+ Grey is included, again.  It's not fully updated
	+ Minor bug fixes
	+ Both Neon and Grey will now only modulate the scale and aggro color of NPC nameplates; PvP colors will automatically pass through
	
	
Beta 3
	+ Fixed some "no target" update errors
	+ Working on cast bar problems; Reverting to older method
	REMOVED - When you click on the Tidy Plates entry in the Interface Options list, it will expand the list, showing all subitems
	+ The debuff widget can be filtered by creating and linking a function to the debuff widget object (widget.Filter)
		example: 
			plate.widgets.AuraIcon.Filter = function(debuffinfo)
				if (debuff.duration < 50 ) or debuff.name == "Hunter's Mark" then return true end
			end
	+ Fixed some aura widget bugs

Beta 4
	+ Cast bar has been totally reverted to older method; Some graphical glitches
		may still occur, but it'll be Blizz's API's fault, this time ;-)
	+ Debug Text has been removed
	+ Note Widget has been repaired
	+ Unit Raid Icon Info  (unit.raidIcon)
		* STAR, MOON, CIRCLE, SQUARE, DIAMOND, CROSS, TRIANGLE, SKULL
			

Beta 6
	+ Fixed some Casting bar bugs
	+ Note widget; Removed interface from neon
	
	
	
Beta 7
	+ Highlight fixed
	+ As a side note; Since Beta 5 the unit text will no longer turn yellow on mouseover, or red when a unit is in combat.

B8...
	+ Cleaned up indicator code
	+ Unit information table: levelcolorRed, levelcolorGreen, levelcolorBlue
	+ clean up spellcasting errors
	
B9
+ Fooled around with region hiding

B10
+ more casting issues
+ are there any ways that I can make my function names show up in the debug/crash report?


B12
+ Changed "CreateAltStatusbar" to "CreateTidyPlatesStatusbar" so it doesn't conflict with some other addon

	
5.11.5
---------------
* Fixed Statusbar #ind errors  (I hope)

5.11.4
---------------
* Grey Theme: New Customization Tool
	1. Under the "TidyPlates_Grey" folder, you'll find another folder, "TidyPlates_GreyExtension"
	2. To use it, begin by moving that folder up to your Addons folder
	3. Open the file, "TidyPlates_GreyExtension\GreyExtension.lua"
	4. You can directly modify the default behavior and appearance
	5. This process can be duplicated for any theme, and will not get overwritten by an update
	Post a comment, or write me an email (binbwen@gmail.com) if you need some help with this
* A full status update will now be performed when the cast bar is shown, to prevent null values

5.11.3
---------------
* Castborder size is being reset during odd times; Added improvements to restore the shape
* Fixed the issue with Grey aggro borders not remaining hidden after /reloads (saved variable merge issue)
* Fixed crazy errors - sorry folks!  

5.11.1
---------------
* Problems with OnInitialize not being called (widget errors occuring during combat)  An attempted fix is applied.
* Fixed unit.class updates (hopefully)

5.11.0
---------------
/greydps and /greytank are the new shortcuts

* Added Debuff widgets to Grey/Tank
* Health text in Grey; "%x" will now read "x%"
* Added outline to text of Threat Line Widget (makes it easier to read in a cluttered battle)
*  also decreased the text size
* Threat Line Widget will look to see if the player is marked as a Main Tank in the Raid settings. If so, it will display the person who has pulled aggro (Target of). otherwise, it will assume dps mode and hide the tank name.
* Threat Line will color the Lost side green if it's being held by a tank

* Added a Statusbar wrapper, which fixes Lucky Charms, and enables vertical stat bars with masks
* Added basic Debuff icons
* Fixed Virtual Plates compatibility (Thanks Saiket!!) 
* Fixed layering issues (Plates over map/combattext/etc)

Theme function Changes:
* theme.OnInitialize will get called every time a nameplate is shown.  Authors should check for
exsisting objects/widgets before creating new ones.
*theme.OnUpdate is called when the data on the plate is updated.  This does not need a existence 
check since it's guaranteed to run after an OnInitialize.

5.10.5
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Went back to LiberationSans for default font.  Why?  I like it!

5.10.4
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

5.10.3
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
+ Fixed "Hide Neutrals"
+ Went to ArialNarrow for the default font
+ Grey\DPS 
	+ Added Hide Neutrals, Ignore Elites
+ Added SetPoint to extended (just in case)
+ Changed health bar color gathering to assist duels

- Removed from loading procedure:
	- SetCVar("CameraDistanceMaxFactor", 6)
	- SetCVar("threatWarning", 3)
	- SetCVar("ShowClassColorInNameplate", 1)
	- SetCVar("showVKeyCastbar", 1)

+ Re-enabled Cursor Update Event

5.10.1
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

+ move widgets to .widget
+ add a target widget to grey (testing)

5.10
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
++ "Avoid Overlap" (Alias) in panel
++ "Autoshow" Option in panel
++ Independent Frame
	* scale pass-through	(Not fully implemented; using Virtual Plates AND a theme which changes scale will show oddities)
	* force alpha override	(The developer can tell Tidy Plates to force the alpha - avoiding Blizzard's default alpha - by returning 'true' as a second value for the return)
		- ex. theme.SetAlpha = function(unit) return 1, true end  -- Will maintain the opacity at 100%, regardless of target status
++ Set Default CVars after VARIABLES_LOADED
++ Dual Spec Support (Changes theme based on spec)
	- Added a second dropdown menu in panel
++ Troubleshooting Panel
	- Vkey/Bindings

++ Grey Theme 
	++ Critter/Neutral Filter checkbox

		TidyPlatesThemes["Grey (DPS)"] = config
		TidyPlatesThemes["Grey (Tank)"] =  copytable(config)
++ Virtual Plates should now behave better
	* Scale-changing plates will still cause problemos, but now, ordinary plates will work just fine.

* Added an extended.widget table
	- Theme designers should put all their widget references in this table

[B][SIZE="3"]Beta Versions[/SIZE][/B]

Beta 1
The biggest changes: Independent alpha control, internal widgets, dual spec support, troubleshooting panel, sweeping performance enhancements.

Beta 2
Significant core changes, hopefully for much better performance (it's faster in my own tests).  Started splitting 'Grey' into two themes; Grey/Tank and Grey/DPS.  Both will have their own panels.  Neither panel is finished (or even partially working).

Beta 3
More core changes, and changes to the panel utility functions (not that anyone besides me uses em) Grey Theme modifications (heavy).  "Grey\Tank" is the first subtheme, which will be followed by "Grey\DPS".  If you want to help me out, make some suggestions about "Grey\PVP" features.  Can't promise anything, but I'll give it a shot.

Beta 4
The new Grey theme is pretty much done.  Both Tank and DPS panels are active, and the functions work.  The new widget, "Main Tanked", has been implemented; It looks at your target and mouseovertargets for characters that are main tanks in your raid.  The nameplates will still expand when another player has aggro (in tank mode), but you'll get a nice icon indicating if it's being tanked, or if it's attacking a squishy.  Bear in mind, you need to mouse over the unit for it to work.  The icon will stay active for several seconds, so just sweep your cursor over the mobs.  (Yes, sweeping your cursor over mobs DOES incur some performance hits, since it signals the Tidy Plates core, though nothing that hurts my framerate.  I'm pretty confident that just about ALL of you downloading this have a much faster machine than I do.)

Beta 5
Grey -Fixes for tank and dps saved variables
Grey- Panel improvements
Grey- Function improvements
Scale function changes

Beta 5&6
Bug Fixes n such

Beta 7
Changes to alpha handling, and adding the combo point widget back to the fray.  Added a few more Text modes.  Moved a bunch of things to the 5.10.X/5.11 list.

Beta 8
Changed some performance thingies, fixed some panel items, and retracted the Raid-Tanked widget (for now)

I'm going to move forward toward releasing 5.10.  In order to speed up the process, I had to move some features to future releases.



Threat Widget:
The Threat Widget is simply a statusbar, drawn from the center-line of the nameplates, which represents your relative threat to that unit.  When the bar extends right and becomes amber, you've got the attention of the unit; The length of that bar indicates your lead over the next highest threat-holder.  If the bar extendeds left, the color will change to cyan, indicating that the unit isn't attacking you.  The length of the bar will indicate how far your threat trails behind the top threat-holder.  Additionally, if you are NOT the highest threat-holder, the threat widget will tell you who is.

Summary; Tanks will want to see a right-pointing amber bar, while DPS will want to see left-leaning cyan.  Longer bars are safer.
